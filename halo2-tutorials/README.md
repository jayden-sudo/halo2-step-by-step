### Intro

🎉 Hey there, code warrior! 🎉 Ready for some `halo2` code fill-in-the-blanks <del>exercise</del> fun? This challenge is specially for you to learn **`halo2`** and **Rust**!

### What's the Deal?

Your mission, is to fill in the blanks (literally!) and make sure the circuit compiles and passes all tests.

### Before You Dive In

First thing's first: Ensure your programming environment:

- Rust is all you neeeed. 🛠️

### Start coding!

- `git clone` to fetch the repo.
- Open `src/` and you will see some sneaky blanks like `_____`? 🕵️
- Wanna see some error? Try `cargo test -- --nocapture chap_1::exercise_1::tests::test_chap_1` and feast your eyes on those errors and warnings.
- Now, with your vast ocean of `halo2` and Rust knowledge, try filling in those gaps. Feeling puzzled? Just backtrack and dive into any related reads. 📚

### The Ultimate Quest

Get your terminal to shout `xx success OHHHHHHHHH!`. Go get 'em, tiger! 🚀

------

### 代码练习顺序

```bash
Part-1: 
$ cargo test -- --nocapture chap_1::exercise_1::tests::test_chap_1
$ cargo test -- --nocapture chap_1::exercise_2::tests::test_chap_1

Draw:
$ cargo test --all-features -- --nocapture chap_1::exercise_1::tests::plot_chap_1_circuit 
```




There you go ~ 🎈
